# PyBer_Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to provide some understanding about ridesharing data in Urban, Suburban and Rural areas.

Since ridesharing services are becoming more popular everyday, we are hoping that this analysis will show us what is the correlations between the number of riders and drivers for each city type and how it effects the fares.

## Results

Per our analysis, Urban cities generates the most total fare value $39,854.38, followed by Suburban cities $19,356.33 and rural cities are on the bottom of our list with $4,327.93 This is actually not suprising when we know cities are much more crowded and more alive than rural areas. Urban cities have more drivers with more rides than rural cities. However when we take a look at the average fare amount per ride, our order switches. Average fare per ride is much more higher in rural cities than urban cities. Riders in urban cities pay less per ride. This tells us that probably due to competition in the urban cities, drivers dropped the prices.

As shown below, total fare by cities also effected by time period. Looking at his line chart we can say that Urban cities seem to bring a lot of revenue in the end of February and beginning of March. Suburban cities bring the most revenue around end of February, meanwhile rural cities reach their most revenue in April.

## Summary

Overall, urban cities have the highest revenue in comparison to suburban and rural cities. It is probably related with lower fare rates, which brings more riders and increase the total revenue.

If we had more data about the rest of the year, demographic information about the riders, we might get more insight about this analyis which would expand our understanding about consumer behaviour.
